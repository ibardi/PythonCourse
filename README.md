# PythonCourse

This repository contains my submissions for a Python-based course that I am taking at Babson College. The repository is made public so that my professor and TA can more readily access it. This also means that I am unable to prevent others from copying my work posted through GitHub. As such, I don't take responsibility for anyone using my code in anyway that violates academic honesty. Otherwise, feel free to use the code in whatever way you wish.
